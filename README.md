# INSULTR

## WARNING: the insults are not mine, they are from https://evilinsult.com/api/?ref=public_apis#insults, which has some incredibly tastless and childish insults (WIP)

a tool to use in scripts and CLI applications to insult the user when doing something wrong
currently planned to use api for the insults, maybe local insult support in the future
written in go (my first project in go)

WIP
